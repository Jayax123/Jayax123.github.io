                <p>Some say they have seen aliens! Most describe them as green and some people even take nice looking photos! As you can see from these two photos aliens come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.</p>
                <p>If you have seen an alien please contact me at <i>999-999-9999</i> and tell me about it! Please I really need more information to add to this page!</p>

                <p>Sadly all the images in this have been created to simulate what actual aliens may look like!</p>
                <p>If you have actual pictures of aliens please please please send me them so I can post them here and say I have actual 100% real pictures of aliens!
