            <p>As a part of my portfolio their will probably be the grant proposal written for the Professional Writing class in that I wrote of green roofs, so a image of one could be used in the portfolio as well.</p>

            <p>I will have through these classes, as well as a minor in computer science a few different references to programming knowledge in my portfolio along with a few programming projects this image could be used to populate the section with a visual element.</p>

            <p>I will probably not use this in a portfolio opting for a more germane picture of me to show my qualifications, but it is a photo that shows me and can be used to represent me.</p>
