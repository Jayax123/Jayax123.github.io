    <h1>Get to know me!</h1>
    <p>My name is Jaydon T. Ongley, and I currently go to the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am a junior and
        will graduate in 2026 with a degree in English with a concentration in creative writing and a minor in computer
        science, along with a certificate in professional and technical writing. I have an interest and passion for both
        writing and programming, which influences my schoolwork, work, and hobbies. I also have hobbies such as fiction
        writing and game programming.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>When I was little, I actually didn’t enjoy reading. It wasn’t until I was about halfway through middle school
        that I really started to enjoy reading and began reading outside of what was required for my classes (though I
        often didn’t even read those assigned stories). I began reading prodigiously, and for much of my schooling from
        middle school through college, you could often find me reading a book now mostly on Kindle, but previously books
        I would check out from the library.</p>

    <p>Programming, unlike reading, I hadn’t discovered until later in life. rowing up, I had limited access to
        technology, and being in a rural area, programming classes weren’t available in school. I only truly got into
        programming later in high school and into college where I began pursuing an education in it, beginning with a
        few classes and finding myself truly enjoying it.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I have a wide variety of interests, but overall, I am a nerd. I enjoy DnD, Warhammer, and other sci-fi/fantasy
        properties. Similarly, I mostly write in speculative fiction, though I will often write outside the genre
        whenever it suits my interests. I also program often, both for classes and work, but also as a hobby
        particularly making simple games, which has currently occupied my programming interests.</p>
