        <h1>What Are Leafcutter Ants?</h1>
        <h2>Fungus Growing Ants</h2>
        <p>
            Leafcutter ants grow fungus within their colonies, which they feed the leaves they are named after cutting.
            They eat this fungus, which is special to their colony, making them one of the first examples of
            domestication! There are over 55 species of leafcutter ants, and many grow their fungus in different ways,
            primarily divided between higher and lower attine leafcutter ants. Leafcutter ants are a fascinating species and to learn more about them you may look <a href="https://ielc.libguides.com/sdzg/factsheets/leafcutter-ant">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Higher VS Lower Attine Leafcutter Ants</h2>
        <p>Higher attine leafcutter ants are considered more sophisticated in their fungus cultivation. This can be seen through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>The fungi is specifically domesticated for the ants use</p></li>
            <li><p>The fungi no longer produces spores</p></li>
            <li><p>The fungi produces swollen hyphal tips to specifically feed the ants better</p></li>
            <li><p>The ants feed their fungus fresh plant matter</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Keeping Leafcutter Ants</h2>
        <p>Leafcutter ants can be hard to keep in indoor enclosures and are probably not recommended for new antkeepers. If you do decide to keep leafcutter ants, you can find important information <a href="https://www.formiculture.com/topic/15532-cheetos-ultimate-guide-to-leafcutter-antsâ„¢/">here</a>, but here are some key facts to keep in mind:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Leafcutter Ants Require Large Enclosures</li>
            <li>Leafcutter Ants Require Proper Humidity Control</li>
            <li>Leafcutter Ants May Require Expanding Enclosures As The Colonies Grow To Almost A Million Workers</li>
            <li>Leafcutter Ants Have Complex Care Requirments And Are Not Suggested For New Antkeepers</li>
        </ol>
