    <h1>What is PWTC?</h1>

    <p id="intro"> PWTC is a <i>five-course certificate</i> in Professional Writing and Technical Communication that
        provides:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>practice in technical writing, editing, and software documentation;</li>
        <li>hands-on training in a range of industry-standard software;</li>
        <li>an introduction to theories and practices of information design.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Since <em>1990</em>, the PWTC program has enjoyed an impressive record of job placement, with graduates embarking
        on
        careers in technical writing, user experience (UX), and information design. Some are employed by nonprofits and
        government agencies, others by firms involved with healthcare, software development and information technology.
